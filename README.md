# [Metric-Imperial Converter](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/quality-assurance/quality-assurance-projects/metric-imperial-converter)

This is a Metric-Imperial Converter microservices project for Free Code Camp Quality Assurance Course.

The base code is from the Metric-Imperial Converter Microservice Boilerplate linked above. I added the routing and logic necessary to complete the user stories for the challenge.

Since this project is contained within the Quality Assurance Course, I wrote unit tests and functional tests to help validate all input and output are within desired expectations.
